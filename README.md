cotext-prototype
================

Synopsis: Prototype for a language learning app to assist Greek/Hebrew language learners.

Dev environment requires the following to be installed:

1.  Node http://nodejs.org/
2.  MongoDB http://www.mongodb.org/

After the above dependencies are installed, run the following commands:

1.  git clone <this repository>
2.  cd <this repository>
3.  sudo npm install
4.  sudo bower install
5.  grunt serve

You'll need a mongoDB proces running at the same time in order for this to work also, so make sure you run the command "mongod" in another bash shell/command prompt.

Some of these installation instructions will be different on Windows.
